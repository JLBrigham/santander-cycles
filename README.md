This was the very first afternoon challenge we attempted on the Makers course as part of our pair programming sessions.

I have decided to redo the challenge by myself now that I have finished the course to remind myself how much I have learned. When originally completing this challenge I found it very challenging at times and did not necesarily have the time I would have liked to look at all the fundemental concepts in detail. I  have taking that time on redoing the challenge to ensure my understanding is as thorough as can be.

I plan next to complete the challenge in Javascript
